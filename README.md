## Smoothing Algorithm
This application contains basic live data smoothing techniques and algorithms to help smooth the noise of the eye tracking data stream.

If you are interested in possibling improving performance, Professor Manu Kumar from Stanford University has published a paper 
containing pseudocode for the implementation of a smoothing algorithm specifically for eye tracking.
